&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a backdoor?
A weapon in your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many americans think that having a weapon is a right and a freedom act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/12/21/nra-only-way-to-stop-a-bad-guy-with-a-gun-is-with-a-good-guy-with-a-gun/&quot;&gt;Wayne LaPierre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans are experimenting nowadays the result of such an idea: nobody thought that taking a firearm is easy for you and the same for a mentally unstable guy. The same applies to thieves, killers, drug dealers and so on.
This is the best option. The worst one is having a fatal accident: life can be really hard if you really fail to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cullmantimes.com/news/family-father-shot-killed-son-in-accidental-shooting-christmas-eve/article_367964d2-eb3f-11e7-8749-ab76c8ec4894.html&quot;&gt;build your values&lt;/a&gt;. 
It is not surprisingly to see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate&quot;&gt;United States is at the top of the list for firearm related death rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So what is a backdoor on your devices?
It is the same as a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The is no difference. Knowing all about your life, your family, your finance and having the power of manipulating you… &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerworlduk.com/security/security-backdoors-that-heped-kill-faith-in-security-3634220/&quot;&gt;It is a weapon&lt;/a&gt;.
It is true that the main purpose can be public safety… But knowing what America did and currently does with information is absolutely a full stop for me. The breach is widespread and we suffered all from human stupidity: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team&quot;&gt;2015 Hacking Team episode is not really fully exhausted&lt;/a&gt;.
The same tools that are offered to democratic governments for public safety are widely used by repressive governments for command and control.
… And the same tools that can be used for defensive measures are widely used for offensive purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IOT world is enhancing the issue: security is every day more difficult to reach.
What can be a security webcam to check your house safety, can be also a way to know when you are at home and how to enter.
What you can use to check your baby, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/healthline-/parental-warning-your-bab_b_11668882.html&quot;&gt;can be used to hijack your home&lt;/a&gt;. There is no way to trust electronic vendors: most of them are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/09/fbi_boss_backdooring_encryption/&quot;&gt;asked to open backdoors for law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. The real address of a legal backdoor can be good, but the way is usually subtle, tricky and it cannot guarantee the real result. This is the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/nsa-linux-journal-extremist-forum-and-its-readers-get-flagged-extra-surveillance&quot;&gt;Linux Journal readers are potentially extremists to be tracked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora&quot;&gt;TEMPORA&lt;/a&gt; will open up the world of communications…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be ready for the IOT revolution and know the weapons in your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer and crafting software is also my real passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very lucky: I have a wonderful
family, a delightful wife, two beautiful daughters and I do what I like as an everyday job.
Not all of us have this kind of luck and I’m aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I forget about it and negative thoughts prevail.
This is the reason I decided to write this blog.
All you can find here, is not exactly what it is, but rather what it should be.
Writing is a big step into the road to improve myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth; not going all the way, and not starting.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;cite title=&quot;Gautama Buddha&quot;&gt;Gautama Buddha&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;cite title=&quot;Michael Jordan&quot;&gt;Michael Jordan&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in the real world is much more difficult than what a blog post can show.
There aren’t enough words to explain the complexity of working with a lot of people,
a lot of different personalities and quite different minds.
Tecnical stuff is pretty easy: learn, try, adopt, think, improve, restart.
Dealing with people is much more difficult and working in the world of connection and globalization is complex.
Every engineer is striken by a lot of tasks, issues, requests, time/resource constraints and conflicts.
Our mind is full of thoughts, all streaming at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all this, you have to look for harmony in your own home and family.
So in the end, a lot of us have some kind of shutdown.
Maybe your shutdown is a violent event or maybe is just a short period.
We need to put organization in our life to restart: be simple, be minimal, do less, do it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last year I read a nice book that helped me to open up my mind a little more.
The name of the book is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenprogrammer.org/&quot;&gt;“Zen Programmer”&lt;/a&gt; by Christian Grobmeier
and it is a nice work that I really suggest to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by oriental phylosophies.
Buddhism and Confucianism theorized about the human
behaviour for centuries. They cover human issues to 360 degrees.
I had a wide path this year.
I discovered Hagakure and the Bushido. I read about samurai codes and values.
I read about chivalry code. I read about minimalism, decluttering, zen.
I found Leo Babauta’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/&quot;&gt;Zen Habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put it all together. Returning on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am a software engineer and &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/care/&quot;&gt;I do care about my work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;small&gt;Me&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are used to have targets and missions.
However the target or the mission is not the end point of your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same.
Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;cite title=&quot;Don Williams Jr.&quot;&gt;Don Williams Jr.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is the journey.
So we have to learn and work hard to improve ourself.
There are multiple colors in the world: not only black and not only white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is needed for us to see and appreciate all the nuances.&lt;br /&gt;
The middle way is the key.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not be strict. Do not be careless.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not be stubborn. Do not be submissive.&lt;br /&gt;
Look. Do not close your eyes to the world.&lt;br /&gt;
Listen. Do not allow your ego to prevail others.&lt;br /&gt;
Care.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the difference between crashing into things and beeing part of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Me&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
