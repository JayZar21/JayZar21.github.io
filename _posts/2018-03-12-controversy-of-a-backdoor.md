What is a backdoor?
A weapon in your house.

Many americans think that having a weapon is a right and a freedom act.

Americans are experimenting nowadays the result of such an idea: nobody thought that taking a firearm is easy for you and the same for a mentally unstable guy. The same applies to thieves, killers, drug dealers and so on.
This is the best option. The worst one is having a fatal accident: life can be really hard if you really fail to [build your values](http://www.cullmantimes.com/news/family-father-shot-killed-son-in-accidental-shooting-christmas-eve/article_367964d2-eb3f-11e7-8749-ab76c8ec4894.html). 
It is not surprisingly to see that [United States is at the top of the list for firearm related death rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate).

The is no difference. Knowing all about your life, your family, your finance and having the power of manipulating you… [It is a weapon](https://www.computerworlduk.com/security/security-backdoors-that-heped-kill-faith-in-security-3634220/).
It is true that the main purpose can be public safety… But knowing what America did and currently does with information is absolutely a full stop for me. The breach is widespread and we suffered all from human stupidity: the [2015 Hacking Team episode is not really fully exhausted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team).
The same tools that are offered to democratic governments for public safety are widely used by repressive governments for command and control.
… And the same tools that can be used for defensive measures are widely used for offensive purposes.

The IOT world is enhancing the issue: security is every day more difficult to reach.
What can be a security webcam to check your house safety, can be also a way to know when you are at home and how to enter.
What you can use to check your baby, [can be used to hijack your home](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/healthline-/parental-warning-your-bab_b_11668882.html). There is no way to trust electronic vendors: most of them are currently [asked to open backdoors for law enforcement](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/09/fbi_boss_backdooring_encryption/). The real address of a legal backdoor can be good, but the way is usually subtle, tricky and it cannot guarantee the real result. This is the point.

In a world where [Linux Journal readers are potentially extremists to be tracked](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/nsa-linux-journal-extremist-forum-and-its-readers-get-flagged-extra-surveillance) and [TEMPORA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora) will open up the world of communications…
